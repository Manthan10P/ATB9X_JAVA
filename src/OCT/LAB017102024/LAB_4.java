//Equilateral Triangle: A triangle is said to be equilateral triangle if all the sides are equal.
// If X, Y, Z are three sides of the triangle.Then, the triangle is equilateral only if X = Y = Z.

//Isosceles Triangle: A triangle is said to be an isosceles triangle if any of its two sides are equal.
// If X, Y, Z are three sides of the triangle.Then, the triangle is isosceles if either X = Y or X = Z or Y = Z.

//Scalene Triangle: A triangle is said Scalene Triangle if none of its sides is equal.
